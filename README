The Python program braincolorgraph.py performs the following steps:

1. Reads in an Excel file with (an optionally weighted) connection matrix,
   where each row and column represents a region of the brain.
2. Converts the matrix to a NetworkX weighted graph.
3. Creates a colormap for the number of brain regions, with hues that are 
   uniformly distributed about a cylindrical color space, such as CIELch.
4. Plots the colormap, the graph, or modifies an input XML file. The program 
   recolor_eps.[csh,py] uses the modified XML file to recolor EPS files.

The program plots either the whole graph, or a collection of subgraphs, 
with each subgraph representing a collection of adjacent regions, 
and assigns adjacent colors in the color space.  
All permutations are computed for the colors of each subgraph, 
and the winning permutation is the one that maximizes the
discriminability of the colors of nodes of highest degree.
This is performed by mulfiplying the connection matrix for each subgraph
by the color difference matrix for each permutation.
